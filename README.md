1. Project Title

Next Word Prediction Project

2. Description

A Python-based next-word prediction model built using LSTM neural networks. The project provides a Flask app (app.py) where users can input text and get next-word predictions based on a trained LSTM model and tokenizer. It was trained on the text of "Hamlet".

3. Repository Structure

app.py: Flask-powered API/web app for user input and next-word prediction.

experiemnts.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing experiments, model training, and evaluation.

hamlet.txt: Text data (likely Shakespeare's Hamlet) used for training.

next_word_lstm.h5: Pre-trained LSTM model file.

tokenizer.pickle: Tokenizer object used to convert text to sequences for model input.

requirements.txt: Python dependencies required to run the project.

4. Requirements & Installation
git clone https://github.com/Rohitcodermanit/Next_word_predicton_project.git
cd Next_word_predicton_project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Usage

Training (if desired):
Open and run experiemnts.ipynb to train your own model using hamlet.txt.

Prediction (Flask App):

python app.py

Then head to http://localhost:5000/ (or whichever endpoint/app interface exists) and enter a text prompt to receive next-word suggestions.

6. How it Works

The model uses an LSTM neural network architecture, typically taking a sequence of tokens (text input) generated by the tokenizer. It predicts the next probable word by feeding input sequences into the LSTM and decoding the output token.

7. Dependencies

Keywords from requirements.txt â€” e.g.:

Flask

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pickle (for tokenizer)
